# CSCI 4144 Data Mining and Warehousing Project - Implementing C4.5 Decision Tree Algorithm for Medical Data Mining 

## Program Description:
        This program implements Quinlan's C4.5 decision tree from scratch, and conducts experiments using the UCI
        ML repo Thyroid disease dataset for binding proteins (allbp). Specifically, this program uses two classes,
        Node and C45Tree to construct the decision tree using the Information gain ratio from information theory.
