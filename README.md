# CSCI 4144 Data Mining and Warehousing Project - Implementing C4.5 Decision Tree Algorithm for Medical Data Mining 

## Program Description:
This program implements Quinlan's C4.5 decision tree from scratch, and conducts experiments using the UCI
ML repo Thyroid disease dataset for binding proteins (allbp). Specifically, this program uses two classes,
Node and C45Tree to construct the decision tree using the Information gain ratio from information theory.

## Repository Directory:
               
    - /original_data                # directory stores allbp.data and allbp.test from [3]
    - /printed_trees                # directory stores text files containing the printed trees from experiments                    
    - README.md 
    - allbp_data.csv                # Training Data from [3]
    - allbp_test.csv                # Testing Data from  [3]
    - c45.py                        # Core program that implements C4.5 algorithm and conducts experiments
    - data_cleaning.py              # Simple script to clean original data from [3] and convert it to csv file for processing by pandas
    - full_experiments_allpb.txt    # contains experimental results for fully trained trees
    - initial_testing_results.txt   # contains experimental results for 100-sample, 500-sample, and fully trained trees
    - report.pdf                    # final report submitted for project deliverables


## How to reproduce experimental results:
1. Navigate to the project repository
2. Run the c45.py program with the following command: `python3 c45.py`
3. View progress in terminal and final results in initial_testing_results.txt and full_experiments_allpb.txt.

Note: data_cleaning.py is only used to convert files to csv, files are already in csv format for c45.py file processing.

## Results:
- Fully trained tree: average training accuracy of 95.32% and testing accuracy of 96.91% over three trials
- 100-sample tree: 96.00% training accuracy, 95.83% testing accuracy
- 500-sample tree: 99.00% training accuracy, 97.58% testing accuracy
